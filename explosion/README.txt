To make this program I looked at man pages, class slides and asked  
Sarah Hoven questions about the timer.


This is my assignment ! 
It is a lunar lander.....
my improvements are a pretty ship


you must be going less than a velocity of 30

I used timer and ncurses code and intersection code from...



Compile by typing make

Run by typing ./lander -g 9.8 -t 20 -f landscape.txt
**note this is just an example! 
**-g is for gravity. Please put a number in after
**-t is for thrust. Please put a number in after
**-f is for an input file. Any input file will work


Run IMPROVEMENT STAGE by typing ./lander -g 9.8 -t 20 -f landscape.txt -i
**note this is just an example! 
**-g is for gravity. Please put a number in after
**-t is for thrust. Please put a number in after
**-f is for an input file. Any input file will work
**-i is for all the impovements I have made
